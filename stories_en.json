    "content": "<b>Part 1: Danger in Mecca</b><br>The disbelievers of Mecca plotted to kill Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Allah ordered him to migrate (Hijrah). In the darkness of the night, the Prophet (PBUH) took his companion Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (RA) and headed towards the Cave of Thawr. <br><br><b>The Struggle on the Way: </b><br>The disbelievers pursued them. At one point, the enemies came right to the cave's entrance, but Allah commanded a spider to weave a web at the cave's entrance and a pigeon to lay eggs. When the disbelievers saw this, they thought: <i>No one could be inside!</i> and they turned back. <br><br><b>The Loyalty of Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA):</b> <br>In the cave, a snake bit him, but he remained silent so as not to disturb the Prophet's (PBUH) sleep. Later, when the Prophet (PBUH) saw him, blood was flowing from his foot. He asked: <b><i>Why didn't you tell me?</i></b> Abu Bakr (RA) said: <b><i>This small pain was not greater than your sleep, O Messenger of Allah!</i></b><br><br><b>Part 2: The Journey to Medina</b> <br><br>After spending 3 days in the cave, they set out for Medina with the help of a guide named Abdullah bin Uraiquit. Miracles happened along the way: <br><b>The Bandit Suraqah: </b><br> The disbelievers sent a powerful warrior named Suraqah, promising him 100 camels to capture the Prophet (PBUH). As Suraqah approached, his horse sank into the sand. He asked for forgiveness, and the Prophet (PBUH) promised him he would wear the keys to Persia's treasures (which later came true).<br><br> <b>The Hut of Umm Ma'bad: </b><br> They passed by an old woman (Umm Ma'bad) who had only one goat. The Prophet (PBUH) milked that goat, and so much milk came out that the entire family was satisfied. <br><br><b>Part 3: Arrival in Medina</b><br> After an 8-day journey, on the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, they reached Quba. Here, the first mosque (Masjid-e-Quba) was built. Then when they reached Medina, the people chanted: <br><b><i>Tala'al-Badru Alayna... (The full moon has risen over us!)</i></b> <br><br><b>The Hospitality of the Ansar (People of Medina):</b> <br>Every family wanted the Prophet (PBUH) to stay at their house. The Prophet (PBUH) said: <br><b><i>My camel will decide where I stay; wherever it sits, that will be my home.</i></b><br> The camel sat in front of the house of Hazrat Abu Ayub Ansari (RA).<br><br><b>Lessons and Inspiration: Trust in Allah (Tawakkul): The spider's web symbolizes Allah's help.<br>Loyalty of a Companion: Abu Bakr's (RA) sacrifice teaches true friendship.<br>Goodness over Evil: Enemies like Suraqah became Muslims by Allah's command.</b><br><br><b>Quran Verse:</b></br><i><b>When Allah's help comes and victory is achieved, and you see people entering Allah's religion in crowds, then glorify your Lord! (Surah An-Nasr 110:1-3)</b></i>"

    "content": "<b>Part 1: The Battlefield is Prepared</b> <br>After persecuting the Muslims, Mecca's <b>enemies</b> (Quraish) had seized all their possessions. The Noble Prophet (PBUH) migrated to Medina, but the disbelievers' oppression didn't stop. One day, news came that <b>Abu Sufyan</b>'s caravan (trade party) was returning from Syria, carrying all of Quraish's wealth. The Muslims decided to reclaim their rights at this opportunity.  <br><br><b>Preparation of the Muslims:</b> <br>- Only <b>313 warriors</b>, with 2 horses and 70 camels. <br>- Quraish's army: <b>1000 warriors</b>, 100 horses and abundant weapons. <br>- Muslims didn't even have complete swords. Some companions carried wooden sticks.  <br><br><b>Part 2: Confrontation on the Battlefield</b> <br>On 17 Ramadan, 2 AH, the two armies faced each other at <b>Badr's field</b>. <br><b>Quraish's Arrogance: </b> <br>Abu Jahl (Quraish's chief) said mockingly: <i>These companions of Muhammad (PBUH) are hungry and barefoot! Today we'll erase their existence!</i>  <b>Muslims' Prayer: </b><br>The Prophet (PBUH) raised his hands and prayed:<br><i>O Allah! If this small group is defeated today, no one will remain on earth to worship You!</i><br><br><b>Part 3: Allah's Help Arrives</b>  <br>Allah commanded the angels:  <br><i>Help My servants!</i> (Quran 8:9)  <br><br><b>Miracles occurred:</b>  <br>1. <b>Sandstorm:</b> Sand filled the Quraish's eyes.  <br>2. <b>Angels' Attack: </b> Quraish's warriors were stunned seeing <b>no visible attacker</b>, yet their heads were being severed!  <br>3. <b>Spiritual Strength in Hearts: </b> Muslims fought so fiercely that one companion <b>cut off an enemy camel's leg</b>!  <br><br><b>Outcome: </b><br>- 70 of Quraish's warriors were killed, including <b>Abu Jahl</b>.  <br>- Only <b>14 Muslims</b> were martyred.  <br>- The remaining enemies fled.  <br><br><b>Part 4: The Secret of Victory: </b><br>After the battle, an elderly companion asked:  <br><i>O Messenger of Allah! We were fewer, yet how did we win?</i><br><b>The Prophet (PBUH) declared:  </b><br><br><i>True faith, patience and trust in Allah are the real strength. Those who fought not for worldly glitter but for Allah's religion - only they won!</i><br><br><b>Lessons:<br> 1. Strength lies in sincerity (faith), not numbers.<br> 2. Never lose courage until Allah's help arrives.<br> 3. Fighting for justice is better than submitting to oppression. </b><br><br><br>Quran Verse: </b><br><i>On the day of Badr, you were weak, but Allah helped you. So that it becomes a sign for the believers.</i> (Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:123)"

    "content": "<b>Part 1: Allah's Unique Gift</b>  <br>Allah had given Prophet Solomon (AS) a <b>vast kingdom</b>. His army included humans, jinn and animals. One day while inspecting his troops, the <b>Hoopoe</b> (a special bird) was missing.  <br><br>Solomon (AS) said angrily:  <br><i>I will punish the Hoopoe unless he brings a valid excuse!</i>  <br><br><b>Part 2: The Hoopoe's News</b>  <br>Shortly after, the Hoopoe returned and reported strange news:  <br><i>I saw a city called Sheba, ruled by a woman (Bilqis). She has every blessing, but she and her people worship the sun!</i>  <br><br>Solomon (AS) said:  <br><i>We'll verify if you speak truth or lies!</i>  <br><br><b>Part 3: Bilqis' Invitation</b>  <br>Solomon (AS) sent Bilqis a letter via the Hoopoe:  <i>In Allah's name... Submit to me and believe in Allah!</i>  <br><br>Bilqis thought: <i>This is no ordinary king!</i> She sent Solomon (AS) precious gifts, but Solomon (AS) said:<br><i>I seek not wealth, but your faith!</i>  <br><br><b>Part 4: The Great Miracle</b>  <br>To test Solomon's power, Bilqis posed a riddle: <br> <i>I will embrace faith if I recognize my throne.</i>  <br>Solomon (AS) commanded a jinn: <i>Bring her throne here!</i>  <br>In the blink of an eye, the throne appeared! Bilqis declared: <i>This is truly Allah's Prophet!</i> and embraced faith.  <br><br><b>Lessons:</b>  <br>1. <b>Be grateful for Allah's blessings</b> – Solomon (AS) never showed arrogance.  <br>2. <b>Even the smallest creature has purpose</b> – The Hoopoe guided an entire nation.  <br>3. <b>Act wisely</b> – Solomon (AS) conquered hearts through wisdom, not war.  <br><br><b>Quran Verse:</b>  <br><i>He (Solomon) smiled and said: 'Why do I not see the Hoopoe?
