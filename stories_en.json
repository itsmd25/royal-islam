    "content": "<b>Part 1: Danger in Mecca</b><br>The disbelievers of Mecca plotted to kill Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Allah ordered him to migrate (Hijrah). In the darkness of the night, the Prophet (PBUH) took his companion Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (RA) and headed towards the Cave of Thawr. <br><br><b>The Struggle on the Way: </b><br>The disbelievers pursued them. At one point, the enemies came right to the cave's entrance, but Allah commanded a spider to weave a web at the cave's entrance and a pigeon to lay eggs. When the disbelievers saw this, they thought: <i>No one could be inside!</i> and they turned back. <br><br><b>The Loyalty of Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA):</b> <br>In the cave, a snake bit him, but he remained silent so as not to disturb the Prophet's (PBUH) sleep. Later, when the Prophet (PBUH) saw him, blood was flowing from his foot. He asked: <b><i>Why didn't you tell me?</i></b> Abu Bakr (RA) said: <b><i>This small pain was not greater than your sleep, O Messenger of Allah!</i></b><br><br><b>Part 2: The Journey to Medina</b> <br><br>After spending 3 days in the cave, they set out for Medina with the help of a guide named Abdullah bin Uraiquit. Miracles happened along the way: <br><b>The Bandit Suraqah: </b><br> The disbelievers sent a powerful warrior named Suraqah, promising him 100 camels to capture the Prophet (PBUH). As Suraqah approached, his horse sank into the sand. He asked for forgiveness, and the Prophet (PBUH) promised him he would wear the keys to Persia's treasures (which later came true).<br><br> <b>The Hut of Umm Ma'bad: </b><br> They passed by an old woman (Umm Ma'bad) who had only one goat. The Prophet (PBUH) milked that goat, and so much milk came out that the entire family was satisfied. <br><br><b>Part 3: Arrival in Medina</b><br> After an 8-day journey, on the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, they reached Quba. Here, the first mosque (Masjid-e-Quba) was built. Then when they reached Medina, the people chanted: <br><b><i>Tala'al-Badru Alayna... (The full moon has risen over us!)</i></b> <br><br><b>The Hospitality of the Ansar (People of Medina):</b> <br>Every family wanted the Prophet (PBUH) to stay at their house. The Prophet (PBUH) said: <br><b><i>My camel will decide where I stay; wherever it sits, that will be my home.</i></b><br> The camel sat in front of the house of Hazrat Abu Ayub Ansari (RA).<br><br><b>Lessons and Inspiration: Trust in Allah (Tawakkul): The spider's web symbolizes Allah's help.<br>Loyalty of a Companion: Abu Bakr's (RA) sacrifice teaches true friendship.<br>Goodness over Evil: Enemies like Suraqah became Muslims by Allah's command.</b><br><br><b>Quran Verse:</b></br><i><b>When Allah's help comes and victory is achieved, and you see people entering Allah's religion in crowds, then glorify your Lord!

The earth had cracked, tree leaves had dried up and fallen, and wells had turned into mud. The sound of children crying echoed day and night, and women had started grinding pieces of clay to make <i>bread</i>. Hazrat Umar (RA) was sitting in his room reciting verses of the Quran when suddenly there was a knock at his door.<br><br>A soldier breathlessly delivered the news: <i>Ameerul Mumineen! People have broken the door of the Baitul Mal. They say the grain has been stolen!</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) picked up his lamp and went out. The white hairs in his beard had turned whiter with worry.<br><br><b>The Grain Theft: Uncovering a Conspiracy</b><br>Upon going to the Baitul Mal storage, they found sacks of grain missing. There were specific marks on the ground—footprints of camels and a broken seal. Hazrat Umar (RA) looked at the marks carefully and asked: <i>Has any new trader come to the city?</i> People told him yes, a trader had come from Yemen who had brought goods loaded on camels.<br><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) went straight to that trader's location. The trader lowered his head as soon as he saw him. Hazrat Umar (RA) said: <i>'The footprints of your camels were found in the Baitul Mal. Do you realize how great a crime this is?'</i> There was not anger, but sorrow in Hazrat Umar's (RA) voice.<br><br>The trader said trembling: <i>Forgive me, Ameerul Mumineen! I did this for my children who were writhing in hunger. </i> Hazrat Umar (RA) put his hand on his shoulder and said: <i>If you had told me, I would have given you my share. But theft has turned your compulsion into a sin.</i><br><br>He forgave the trader but made new rules for the security of the Baitul Mal. That night, Hazrat Umar (RA) put all the grain from his own house into the Baitul Mal and started surviving on only water and dates himself.<br><br><b>Relief Convoy from Egypt: A New Hope</b><br>In the sixth month of the famine, the Governor of Egypt, Amr ibn al-Aas (RA), sent wheat, dates, and medicines on 500 camels. When the convoy reached near Medina, Hazrat Umar (RA) himself went to receive it. He lifted the first sack of wheat onto his shoulder and said: <i>This sack is for that old mother who let her children starve to death last week.</i><br><br>People saw that his back bent under the weight of the sack, but his steps did not falter. A young man asked: <i>You are the Caliph, then why are you doing this work?</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) replied with a smile: <i>A Caliph is not one who rules over people, but one who dies for the people.</i><br><br><b>The Night the Caliph Sold His Bed</b><br>One night, Hazrat Umar's (RA) daughter Hafsa (RA) saw that he was sleeping on a mat in his room.<br><i>Father, where is your bed?</i><br>He replied: <i>I sold it to buy milk for an orphan girl. As long as my subjects sleep hungry, how can I sleep on a soft bed?</i><br><br>Hafsa's (RA) eyes filled with tears. She took off her jewelry and said: <i>Here, sell these and bring food for more children.</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) kissed her head: <i>This very goodness of yours will make you deserving of Paradise.</i><br><br><b>The First Drop of Rain: The Scene of Worship</b><br>After eighteen months, clouds thundered for the first time. Hazrat Umar (RA) stood on the pulpit of the mosque and wept: <i>O Allah! If this rain is Your mercy, then accept it from us. And if it is a punishment, then spare these innocent children.</i><br><br>People saw raindrops dripping from his beard. An old man exclaimed: <i>This is not rain, it is the fruit of the prayers of Allah's Prophet (PBUH)!</i><br><br>That same night, Hazrat Umar (RA) distributed seeds and agricultural tools from the Baitul Mal to every household. He announced: <i>From today, every newborn child will have the right to education and food from the Baitul Mal.</i><br><br><b>The Final Lesson: The Letter That Became History</b><br>After the famine ended, Hazrat Umar (RA) wrote a letter to all provincial governors: <i>Know that the purpose of your authority is to serve the people. If there is no fire burning in someone's home, then know that you have lost Allah's trust.</i><br><br>This letter of his is still an example for governments all over the world. Whenever a ruler forgets the suffering of the people, this story of Hazrat Umar (RA) reminds him that <i>true faith is that which feeds the hungry and supports the orphan.</i><br><br><b><i>Umar (RA) taught that the victory of humanity is the real victory. And he was not a landlord, but a sympathizer of those who walk on the earth.</i></b>"

She always said:<br><i>Umar (RA) taught me that humanity is the greatest faith.</i><br><br>This story is still alive in the hearts of those who believe that <i>wiping one tear is better than a thousand acts of worship.</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) proved that <b>real strength is not in the sword, but in love and justice.</b><br><br><b><i>As long as a single heart is sad,<br>The lamp of Khilafah is speechless.<br>Umar's love is that tale,<br>That makes a human, human.</i></b>"

He was in his house with his newlywed wife, Jamil Bint Abdullah (R.A.). The joys of the night had not yet fully settled when, at the break of dawn, the announcement of war was made in Medina - the Quraysh army was advancing towards Uhud.<br><br>When Hanzala (R.A.) heard this call, a strange seriousness came over his face. His wife asked, <i>What is it? Why do you look so sad?</i> Hanzala replied, <i>My dear, the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.) has declared Jihad. I must get ready and leave immediately.</i> His wife said, <i>But you haven't even performed Ghusl (ritual bath). At least take a bath and then go.</i> Hanzala replied firmly, <i>If I delay, the gates of Paradise might close for me. I promise, when I return, I will spend more time with you.</i><br><br>Saying this, Hanzala (R.A.) picked up his weapon and joined the army of the Noble Prophet (S.A.W.) directly. On the battlefield of Uhud, when the battle began, Hanzala displayed incredible bravery. He was striking down the strongest warriors of Abu Sufyan's army. It is said that sparks from his sword were visible from far away.<br><br>Then a strange event occurred. Hanzala (R.A.) suddenly saw the image of his wife calling out to him. This was a delusion from Satan. Hanzala immediately closed his eyes and prayed, <i>O Allah! Save me from this trial. My heart is only attached to Your path.</i> At that very moment, while he was fighting this delusion, Abu Sufyan's brother, Shaddad, struck from behind, and Hanzala (R.A.) was martyred.<br><br>After the battle ended, when the Noble Prophet (S.A.W.) went out to see the martyrs on the field, his eyes fell on the body of Hanzala (R.A.). It was an amazing sight - Hanzala's body was completely clean, water was dripping from his hair, and a fragrance of musk was emanating from his entire body. The Noble Prophet (S.A.W.) said, <i>I saw the angels washing Hanzala with the water of the clouds.</i><br><br>The companions asked, <i>O Messenger of Allah, why did Hanzala receive this reward?</i> The Noble Prophet (S.A.W.) explained, <i>Because he remembered Allah sincerely when he set out for Jihad. His intention was pure. He sacrificed the dearest thing in the world (his newly married life) for the sake of Allah.</i><br><br>Meanwhile, in Medina, Hanzala's wife was waiting for him at the door. When the news of his martyrdom came, she fainted. When Hanzala's parents heard this, they said, <i>Our son has met his Lord in Paradise. This was the day he had always longed for.</i><br><br>This story teaches us that for those who sacrifice in the path of Allah, nothing in the world remains precious. Hanzala (R.A.) proved that a true believer can give up his most beloved thing for the sake of Allah. His martyrdom also teaches us that a person's true purpose is not the life of this world but preparation for the Hereafter.<br><br>Even today, the grave of Hanzala (R.A.) exists in the hills of Uhud, where people go to remember his sacrifice and raise their hands in prayer. His name is forever recorded in history as <b><i>Ghasilul Malaika</i></b> (The one washed by the Angels)."

Hazrat Umar (R.A.) was roaming the streets of Medina in the last third of the night, as was his habit. A sack of flour and dates was slung over his shoulder. Just then, he heard the sound of someone groaning from a broken hut. He quickly went inside.<br><br>A Bedouin (desert dweller) was lying in the hut. His face had turned pale, and his stomach was sunken from hunger. His wife and two children were sitting around him. The Bedouin opened his eyes and, upon seeing Hazrat Umar (R.A.), cried out, <i>O Ameerul Mumineen (Leader of the Believers)! I came to your city because I heard stories of your justice, but I have been wronged.</i><br><br>Hazrat Umar (R.A.) sat down gently beside him and asked, <i>What is your complaint?</i> The Bedouin explained that he had taken a loan from a merchant in Medina but could not repay it due to the famine. The merchant had seized his she-camel, which was his family's only property. Hazrat Umar (R.A.) immediately summoned that merchant.<br><br>When the merchant arrived, Hazrat Umar (R.A.) asked him, <i>Is it true that you seized this Bedouin's she-camel?</i> The merchant replied arrogantly, <i>Yes, but this is the law. Property can be seized for non-payment of debt.</i> Hazrat Umar (R.A.) said, trembling with anger, <i>But the law also says that respite should be given during times of famine. You have sacrificed humanity!</i><br><br>He ordered the merchant to return the she-camel immediately and give the Bedouin an additional six months. He also sent rations and medicines for the Bedouin's family from the Baitul Mal. When the merchant said, <i>This is favoritism towards the Bedouin,</i> Hazrat Umar (R.A.) replied, <i>Justice is not favoritism, but about rights. If you have a piece of bread and your neighbor is hungry, then you are under the wrath of Allah.</i><br><br>A few months later, when the rains came and the Bedouin repaid his debt, he fell at the feet of Hazrat Umar (R.A.) and said, <i>You not only saved my she-camel, but you also saved my faith.</i> Hazrat Umar (R.A.) lifted him up and said, <i>This was my duty. The meaning of a Caliph is that he is responsible for every breath of his subjects.</i><br><br>This story spread like wildfire through the streets of Medina. People understood that the justice of Islam is not just bookish law, but is connected to the depths of the heart. Hazrat Umar (R.A.) proved that true justice is that which understands a person's pain and considers their helplessness as its own. Even today, whenever justice is discussed, this story is remembered of how a Caliph left his throne to set an example of humanity in a Bedouin's hut in the desert."

    "content": "<b>Part 1: Unique Incidents from the Days of Ignorance</b><br><i>The childhood incident when Hazrat Umar challenged his father</i><br>Hazrat Umar's (R.A.) father, Khattab ibn Nufayl, was among the severe oppressors of Makkah. One day, the ten-year-old Hazrat Umar (R.A.) saw his father brutally beating a slave. The young Hazrat Umar showed courage and asked:<br><i>Father, why are you beating this innocent person?</i><br>Khattab said angrily:<br><i>How dare you interfere in my work?</i><br>Hazrat Umar (R.A.) replied firmly:<br><i>Because oppression is wrong in any circumstance, no matter who does it!</i><br>This incident shook Khattab's heart, and from that day on, he changed his behavior towards slaves.<br><br><i>The thrilling tale from his youth when Hazrat Umar intended to kill his sister</i><br>Before Islam, Hazrat Umar's (R.A.) sister Fatimah and brother-in-law Saeed ibn Zayd had accepted Islam. When Hazrat Umar (R.A.) found out, he reached their house with a sword. When he knocked on the door, he heard the sound of Quran recitation from inside. When he saw marks of injury on his sister's face, he asked:<br><i>Who did this?</i><br>Fatimah replied:<br><i>An oppressor like you.</i><br>Hearing this, Hazrat Umar's (R.A.) heart softened, and he expressed a desire to hear the Quran. When he heard Surah Taha, he cried and immediately accepted Islam.<br><br><b>Part 2: Unheard Incidents After Accepting Islam</b><br><i>The courageous feat of praying openly in the Kaaba</i><br>When Hazrat Umar (R.A.) became Muslim, he asked the Prophet of Islam (S.A.W.):<br><i>O Messenger of Allah! Will we perform our worship in hiding?</i><br>The Prophet (S.A.W.) said:<br><i>We are weak, O Hazrat Umar.</i><br>Hazrat Umar (R.A.) replied:<br><i>By Allah, who has commanded us to live for the truth, why should we hide?</i><br>Saying this, they divided into two groups: Hamza (R.A.) went with one group and Hazrat Umar (R.A.) with the other. Thus, for the first time, prayer was offered openly in the Kaaba.<br><br><i>The thrilling moment of Hijrah when Hazrat Umar issued a challenge</i><br>When the Muslims had to migrate (Hijrah) from Makkah to Madinah, Hazrat Umar (R.A.) declared:<br><i>Whoever wants to mourn his mother, whoever wants to see his wife widowed and his children orphaned, let him come to stop me!</i> Saying this, he set out alone from Makkah carrying a sword, arrows, and a spear. No one dared to stop him.<br><br><b>Part 3: Unique Stories During His Caliphate</b><br><i>The method of checking on the people's condition in the darkness of night</i><br>After becoming Caliph, Hazrat Umar (R.A.) would patrol the streets of Madinah seriously at night. One night, he saw an old woman trying to quieten children. The children were crying from hunger. Hazrat Umar (R.A.) immediately brought flour, ghee, and dates from the Baitul Mal (public treasury) and himself cooked food and fed the children. The old woman said:<br><i>May Allah make you better than Hazrat Umar.</i><br>Hazrat Umar (R.A.) replied:<br><i>Pray that Hazrat Umar continues to serve you.</i><br><br><i>The unique case of justice when Hazrat Umar punished his son</i><br>Once, Hazrat Umar's (R.A.) son fought with a Jewish man. When the matter reached the court, the Qazi (judge) ruled that the Jewish man had the right to hit Hazrat Umar's son in the same way. Hazrat Umar (R.A.) respected the decision and stood his son before the Jewish man. The Jewish man was so impressed that he forgave him and accepted Islam.<br><br><b>Part 4: The Poignant Incident of His Martyrdom</b><br><i>The final wish to forgive his murderer</i><br>When Firoz Abu Lulu attacked Hazrat Umar (R.A.), he asked in his wounded state:<br><i>Is the attacker Muslim?</i><br>When he found out he was a Magian (Zoroastrian), he breathed a sigh of relief. Then he told his son:<br><i>If I survive, I will forgive him, and if I die, you shall only strike him once.</i><br>Saying this, he prayed for mercy for his murderer.<br><br><i>Words of wisdom in his final moments</i><br>In his last moments, Hazrat Umar (R.A.) said:<br><i>If I have wronged anyone, let them strike my back<br>Form a council of six people for the Caliph after me<br>Bury me next to the Prophet (S.A.W.) and Abu Bakr (R.A.)</i><br><br><b>Part 5: Unseen Aspects of His Personality</b><br>Those unique habits that made Hazrat Umar special<br><b>Patches on clothes:</b> Used to have four patches on his gown<br><b>Simplicity in food:</b> Bread and olive oil were the main meals<br><b>Love for justice:</b> Granted a stipend to the woman who breastfed his son<br><br><b><i>The justice of Umar is that eternal lamp of history that will always remain illuminated - Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib.</i></b>"

    "title": "The Martyrdom of Habib ibn Zayd (R.A.): The Tale of Faith Even After His Tongue Was Cut",
    "content": "Habib ibn Zayd (R.A.) belonged to the Banu Najjar family. His father, Zayd ibn Asim (R.A.), and his mother, Nusayba bint Ka'b (R.A.), were both among the early Muslims.<br><br>Habib ibn Zayd (R.A.) recited the Kalima at the age of 5, migrated to Madinah at the age of 10, and fulfilled the duty of providing water during the Battle of Badr at the age of 12. His mother, Nusayba (R.A.), was famous by the name <i>Umm Umara</i> and was the first female warrior of Islam. She sustained 12 wounds in the Battle of Uhud.<br><br>After the passing of the Noble Prophet (S.A.W.), Musaylimah al-Kadhdhab (the Liar) declared himself a prophet in Yamama, 800 km from Madinah. He misled 40,000 people.<br><br>Caliph Abu Bakr (R.A.) sent an army of 13,000 soldiers in 11 AH to teach Musaylimah al-Kadhdhab a lesson. Despite his young age, Habib (R.A.), who was only 17 years old, sought permission to participate in the battle. Habib's (R.A.) squad was ambushed and attacked. He was captured alive and taken towards Musaylimah's palace.<br><br>The sun was scorching the land of Yamama. Habib (R.A.) was brought as a prisoner to Musaylimah al-Kadhdhab's palace. His hands and feet were bound in chains, but there was no fear on his face. This was Habib ibn Zayd (R.A.), whose father Zayd ibn Asim had been martyred in the Battle of Badr and whose mother Nusayba bint Ka'b was the famous warrior of Uhud.<br><br>Musaylimah asked from his throne, roaring, <i>Do you still believe Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?</i> Habib (R.A.) raised his head and replied, <i>Yes! And I testify that you are the biggest liar!</i> Hearing this, Musaylimah's face turned red with anger. He ordered the executioners, <i>Cut this one's body into pieces, but first cut his tongue so he cannot recite the Kalima!</i><br><br>As soon as the executioner raised his sword, Habib (R.A.) recited the Kalima loudly one last time: <b><i>La ilaha illallah Muhammadur Rasulullah!</i></b> The next moment, his tongue was cut out. A stream of blood flowed, but Habib (R.A.) began writing on the ground with his finger: <b><i>Ashhadu anna Muhammadar Rasulullah.</i></b> (I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)<br><br>Musaylimah was astonished. He ordered, <i>Cut off his hands!</i> The executioners first cut the fingers of his right hand, then of his left hand. With every limb cut, Habib (R.A.) continued writing the Kalima on the ground with his own blood. When both hands were cut off, he continued writing with his broken elbows.<br><br>Finally, Musaylimah ordered, <i>Tie him between two date palm trees and tear him apart!</i> When the executioners pulled the trees apart, Habib's (R.A.) body was split into two pieces. Until his last breath, his lips were moving, as if he was reciting the Kalima invisibly.<br><br>Just three days after this event, Musaylimah was killed. Wahshi ibn Mughirah struck him at the very place where Habib (R.A.) was martyred. It is said that when Musaylimah was dying, he could hear Habib's (R.A.) voice: <i><b>Ashhadu anna Muhammadar Rasulullah!</b></i><br><br>When the news of Habib's (R.A.) martyrdom reached the companions of the Prophet (S.A.W.), Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A.) said, <i>This young man proved that the strength of faith is not measured by age.</i> When Habib's (R.A.) mother, Nusayba, reached her son's body, she said, <i>I have lost a son, but Allah has elevated his status in Paradise.</i><br><br>Even today, on the grave of Habib ibn Zayd (R.A.) in Yamama, it is written: <i>Here lies the martyr who wrote his faith with his blood even after his tongue was cut.</i> His story is a lesson for every Muslim that no sacrifice is too great in the path of faith.<br><br>Hazrat Ali (R.A.) once said, <b><i>Habib ibn Zayd proved that true faith lies in the heart, not on the tongue.</i></b><br><br>This story remains an example for those who wish to remain steadfast in their faith during difficult times."

    "title": "The Miraj of Hazrat Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam): The Tale of the Heavenly Journey",
    "content": "One night in the holy city of Makkah, the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) was resting near the Hijr-e-Aswad. Suddenly, a veil of light spread from the sky and the angel Jibreel (Alayhis Salam) appeared. He seated the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) on a strange mount called <i>Buraq</i>, a heavenly creature shaped between a mule and a horse with wings. This was the first stage called <i>Isra</i> - the night journey from Makkah to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).<br><br>Upon reaching Bayt al-Maqdis, the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) saw that all the prophets were gathered - Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus), and other great prophets. They all prayed behind the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) in congregation. This was a sign that he was now being made the leader of all prophets.<br><br>After this, Jibreel (Alayhis Salam) prepared the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) for the journey to the heavens <i>(Miraj)</i>. They set out on a journey through the seven heavens. On the first heaven, they met Adam (Alayhis Salam), who told them about the people sitting on his right and left - those of Paradise on the right and those of Hell on the left.<br><br>On the second heaven, Yahya (John the Baptist) (Alayhis Salam) and Isa (Jesus) (Alayhis Salam) welcomed him. On the third heaven, they met Yusuf (Joseph) (Alayhis Salam), who said that his Ummah (nation) would be given the most beautiful form. On the fourth heaven, Idris (Enoch) (Alayhis Salam) prayed for the Ummah.<br><br>On the fifth heaven, Harun (Aaron) (Alayhis Salam) embraced the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). On the sixth heaven, Musa (Moses) (Alayhis Salam) wept and said that his people had left him, but the Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad would support him. On the seventh heaven, Ibrahim (Abraham) (Alayhis Salam) was standing near the Baitul Ma'mur (Frequented House), where seventy thousand angels come to pray every day.<br><br>After this, the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) reached <i>Sidrat al-Muntaha</i> (the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary), where Jibreel (Alayhis Salam) said he could go no further. From here, the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) proceeded alone and spoke directly to Allah. At this divine station, he saw great signs of Allah and heard His voice.<br><br>Allah made fifty daily prayers obligatory, but upon the prayer of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) and the advice of Musa (Alayhis Salam), it was reduced to five. This was a great mercy from Allah upon the Ummah.<br><br>When the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) returned to Makkah and narrated this story, the people of Quraysh denied it. But Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A.) immediately said: <i>If he has said it, then he has spoken the truth!</i> For this, he received the title <i>As-Siddiq</i> (the Truthful).<br><br>This great journey of Miraj contained many wisdoms - the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) was shown the heavenly world, the Ummah received the precious gift of prayer, and it proved that anything is possible with Allah's power.<br><br>In the first verse of Surah Al-Isra in the Quran, Allah says: <br><i>Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed.</i><br><br>This story is a reminder for every Muslim that prayer is the Miraj of the believer and that every difficulty can be endured for the love of Allah. The Miraj of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) is not just a journey, but an example of the human soul touching the heavens, teaching us that those who remain steadfast in truth certainly receive Allah's help."
