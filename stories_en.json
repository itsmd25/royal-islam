    "content": "<b>Part 1: Danger in Mecca</b><br>The disbelievers of Mecca plotted to kill Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Allah ordered him to migrate (Hijrah). In the darkness of the night, the Prophet (PBUH) took his companion Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (RA) and headed towards the Cave of Thawr. <br><br><b>The Struggle on the Way: </b><br>The disbelievers pursued them. At one point, the enemies came right to the cave's entrance, but Allah commanded a spider to weave a web at the cave's entrance and a pigeon to lay eggs. When the disbelievers saw this, they thought: <i>No one could be inside!</i> and they turned back. <br><br><b>The Loyalty of Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA):</b> <br>In the cave, a snake bit him, but he remained silent so as not to disturb the Prophet's (PBUH) sleep. Later, when the Prophet (PBUH) saw him, blood was flowing from his foot. He asked: <b><i>Why didn't you tell me?</i></b> Abu Bakr (RA) said: <b><i>This small pain was not greater than your sleep, O Messenger of Allah!</i></b><br><br><b>Part 2: The Journey to Medina</b> <br><br>After spending 3 days in the cave, they set out for Medina with the help of a guide named Abdullah bin Uraiquit. Miracles happened along the way: <br><b>The Bandit Suraqah: </b><br> The disbelievers sent a powerful warrior named Suraqah, promising him 100 camels to capture the Prophet (PBUH). As Suraqah approached, his horse sank into the sand. He asked for forgiveness, and the Prophet (PBUH) promised him he would wear the keys to Persia's treasures (which later came true).<br><br> <b>The Hut of Umm Ma'bad: </b><br> They passed by an old woman (Umm Ma'bad) who had only one goat. The Prophet (PBUH) milked that goat, and so much milk came out that the entire family was satisfied. <br><br><b>Part 3: Arrival in Medina</b><br> After an 8-day journey, on the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, they reached Quba. Here, the first mosque (Masjid-e-Quba) was built. Then when they reached Medina, the people chanted: <br><b><i>Tala'al-Badru Alayna... (The full moon has risen over us!)</i></b> <br><br><b>The Hospitality of the Ansar (People of Medina):</b> <br>Every family wanted the Prophet (PBUH) to stay at their house. The Prophet (PBUH) said: <br><b><i>My camel will decide where I stay; wherever it sits, that will be my home.</i></b><br> The camel sat in front of the house of Hazrat Abu Ayub Ansari (RA).<br><br><b>Lessons and Inspiration: Trust in Allah (Tawakkul): The spider's web symbolizes Allah's help.<br>Loyalty of a Companion: Abu Bakr's (RA) sacrifice teaches true friendship.<br>Goodness over Evil: Enemies like Suraqah became Muslims by Allah's command.</b><br><br><b>Quran Verse:</b></br><i><b>When Allah's help comes and victory is achieved, and you see people entering Allah's religion in crowds, then glorify your Lord! (Surah An-Nasr 110:1-3)</b></i>"

    "content": "<b>Part 1: The Battlefield is Prepared</b> <br>After persecuting the Muslims, Mecca's <b>enemies</b> (Quraish) had seized all their possessions. The Noble Prophet (PBUH) migrated to Medina, but the disbelievers' oppression didn't stop. One day, news came that <b>Abu Sufyan</b>'s caravan (trade party) was returning from Syria, carrying all of Quraish's wealth. The Muslims decided to reclaim their rights at this opportunity.  <br><br><b>Preparation of the Muslims:</b> <br>- Only <b>313 warriors</b>, with 2 horses and 70 camels. <br>- Quraish's army: <b>1000 warriors</b>, 100 horses and abundant weapons. <br>- Muslims didn't even have complete swords. Some companions carried wooden sticks.  <br><br><b>Part 2: Confrontation on the Battlefield</b> <br>On 17 Ramadan, 2 AH, the two armies faced each other at <b>Badr's field</b>. <br><b>Quraish's Arrogance: </b> <br>Abu Jahl (Quraish's chief) said mockingly: <i>These companions of Muhammad (PBUH) are hungry and barefoot!

    "content": "It was a cold night in Medina. Stars twinkled in the sky, and there was a chill in the air. Hazrat Umar (RA) was walking through the city streets by the light of his lamp. It was his habit to go out at night to check on the condition of the people. Just then, he heard a groaning sound from a broken hut. He quickly entered inside.<br><br>An old Jewish man was lying in the hut. He was wearing torn clothes, and his feet were wounded. His eyes were closed, and his lips were parched. Hazrat Umar (RA) sat beside him and asked, <i>Why are you in this condition? Where are your children?</i><br><br>The old man opened his eyes and said softly, <i>My children are dead. I am alone... There is no one to take care of me.</i><br><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) immediately took off his own cloak and covered him with it, saying, <i>From today, I am your son.</i> He got up and headed towards the Baitul Mal (treasury). On the way, he told his companion, <i>Send warm clothes, medicine, and daily food for this elder. This is his right, even if he is Jewish.</i><br><br>The next day, when the old Jewish man saw warm food and medicines placed at his door, he was astonished. He asked, <i>Who sent all this?</i> People told him, <i>Caliph Umar did.</i><br><br>Tears welled up in the old man's eyes. He went straight to Masjid-e-Nabawi. Hazrat Umar (RA) was advising people at that time. The old man exclaimed, <i>O Umar! How beautiful your faith is! I have never seen anyone teach a lesson in humanity like this before!</i><br><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) replied with a smile, <i>Humanity is the real faith. If we leave an elder to go hungry, then our claim of faith is false.</i><br><br>A few days later, that Jewish elder would walk through the streets of Medina telling people, <i>I have seen Umar... he is not just the Caliph of Muslims, but of every human being!</i><br><br><b>Moral of the story:</b><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) taught that humanity is above religion. His justice was for everyone—no matter their religion or community. Even today, this story reminds us that <i>true faith is that which softens the heart and makes the hand charitable.</i><br>"

    "content": "<b>The Beginning of the Drought</b><br>Clouds had not rained water over Medina for two years. The earth had cracked, tree leaves had dried up and fallen, and wells had turned into mud. The sound of children crying echoed day and night, and women had started grinding pieces of clay to make <i>bread</i>. Hazrat Umar (RA) was sitting in his room reciting verses of the Quran when suddenly there was a knock at his door.<br><br>A soldier breathlessly delivered the news: <i>Ameerul Mumineen! People have broken the door of the Baitul Mal. They say the grain has been stolen!</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) picked up his lamp and went out. The white hairs in his beard had turned whiter with worry.<br><br><b>The Grain Theft: Uncovering a Conspiracy</b><br>Upon going to the Baitul Mal storage, they found sacks of grain missing. There were specific marks on the ground—footprints of camels and a broken seal. Hazrat Umar (RA) looked at the marks carefully and asked: <i>Has any new trader come to the city?</i> People told him yes, a trader had come from Yemen who had brought goods loaded on camels.<br><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) went straight to that trader's location. The trader lowered his head as soon as he saw him. Hazrat Umar (RA) said: <i>'The footprints of your camels were found in the Baitul Mal. Do you realize how great a crime this is?'</i> There was not anger, but sorrow in Hazrat Umar's (RA) voice.<br><br>The trader said trembling: <i>Forgive me, Ameerul Mumineen! I did this for my children who were writhing in hunger. </i> Hazrat Umar (RA) put his hand on his shoulder and said: <i>If you had told me, I would have given you my share. But theft has turned your compulsion into a sin.</i><br><br>He forgave the trader but made new rules for the security of the Baitul Mal. That night, Hazrat Umar (RA) put all the grain from his own house into the Baitul Mal and started surviving on only water and dates himself.<br><br><b>Relief Convoy from Egypt: A New Hope</b><br>In the sixth month of the famine, the Governor of Egypt, Amr ibn al-Aas (RA), sent wheat, dates, and medicines on 500 camels. When the convoy reached near Medina, Hazrat Umar (RA) himself went to receive it. He lifted the first sack of wheat onto his shoulder and said: <i>This sack is for that old mother who let her children starve to death last week.</i><br><br>People saw that his back bent under the weight of the sack, but his steps did not falter. A young man asked: <i>You are the Caliph, then why are you doing this work?</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) replied with a smile: <i>A Caliph is not one who rules over people, but one who dies for the people.</i><br><br><b>The Night the Caliph Sold His Bed</b><br>One night, Hazrat Umar's (RA) daughter Hafsa (RA) saw that he was sleeping on a mat in his room.<br><i>Father, where is your bed?</i><br>He replied: <i>I sold it to buy milk for an orphan girl. As long as my subjects sleep hungry, how can I sleep on a soft bed?</i><br><br>Hafsa's (RA) eyes filled with tears. She took off her jewelry and said: <i>Here, sell these and bring food for more children.</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) kissed her head: <i>This very goodness of yours will make you deserving of Paradise.</i><br><br><b>The First Drop of Rain: The Scene of Worship</b><br>After eighteen months, clouds thundered for the first time. Hazrat Umar (RA) stood on the pulpit of the mosque and wept: <i>O Allah! If this rain is Your mercy, then accept it from us. And if it is a punishment, then spare these innocent children.</i><br><br>People saw raindrops dripping from his beard. An old man exclaimed: <i>This is not rain, it is the fruit of the prayers of Allah's Prophet (PBUH)!</i><br><br>That same night, Hazrat Umar (RA) distributed seeds and agricultural tools from the Baitul Mal to every household. He announced: <i>From today, every newborn child will have the right to education and food from the Baitul Mal.</i><br><br><b>The Final Lesson: The Letter That Became History</b><br>After the famine ended, Hazrat Umar (RA) wrote a letter to all provincial governors: <i>Know that the purpose of your authority is to serve the people. If there is no fire burning in someone's home, then know that you have lost Allah's trust.</i><br><br>This letter of his is still an example for governments all over the world. Whenever a ruler forgets the suffering of the people, this story of Hazrat Umar (RA) reminds him that <i>true faith is that which feeds the hungry and supports the orphan.</i><br><br><b><i>Umar (RA) taught that the victory of humanity is the real victory. And he was not a landlord, but a sympathizer of those who walk on the earth.</i></b>"

He had a sack of flour and dates on his shoulder, as he did every night in search of the poor. Just then, he heard the sound of someone crying near a broken mosque. He slowly went closer.<br><br>A little girl, barely seven years old, was huddled in a corner of a stone. Her feet were bare, and her clothes were torn. A stream of tears was flowing from her eyes. Hazrat Umar (RA) asked softly:<br><i>Daughter, why are you crying? Where are your parents?</i><br><br>The girl answered sobbing:<br><i>Mommy used to say... she would never leave me alone... but when she got fever... she left... Daddy also was martyred in the war...</i><br><br>Hazrat Umar's (RA) throat choked up. He took off his own cloak and covered the girl, saying:<br><i>From today, I am your father. Your every need is my responsibility.</i><br><br>He took the girl to his home. On the way, the girl asked:<br><i>Who are you?</i><br>Umar (RA) said with a smile:<br><i>I am the one whom Allah has commanded to take care of people like you.</i><br><br>Upon reaching home, he fed the girl warm food. Seeing her broken slippers, he took off his own shoes and said:<br><i>Here, take these. My feet have traveled a lot, but your feet should not get hurt.</i><br><br>Wiping her tears, the girl asked:<br><i>Why are you doing this for me? I am nobody...</i><br>Hazrat Umar (RA) placed his hand on her head:<br><i>You are a trust from Allah. The day I forget to wipe an orphan's tears, my faith will die.</i><br><br>The next day, Hazrat Umar (RA) announced in the mosque:<br><i>Listen, people of Medina! From today, every orphan child's expenses will be borne by the Baitul Mal. If there is an orphan in anyone's house, I take responsibility for their upbringing!</i><br><br>A few years later, that same girl, whose name was Ayesha, came to the mosque. She placed a roti wrapped in cloth in front of Hazrat Umar (RA) and said:<br><i>Ameerul Mumineen... I made this myself. You taught me how to live, now I will serve you.</i><br><br>Hazrat Umar's (RA) eyes became moist. He picked up a piece of the roti and said:<br><i>This is the bread that has the fragrance of faith. Today I understood that this is the real victory of Khilafah.</i><br><br>That girl later became a famous scholar of Medina and was called the mother of hundreds of orphans. She always said:<br><i>Umar (RA) taught me that humanity is the greatest faith.</i><br><br>This story is still alive in the hearts of those who believe that <i>wiping one tear is better than a thousand acts of worship.</i> Hazrat Umar (RA) proved that <b>real strength is not in the sword, but in love and justice.</b><br><br><b><i>As long as a single heart is sad,<br>The lamp of Khilafah is speechless.<br>Umar's love is that tale,<br>That makes a human, human.</i></b>"
